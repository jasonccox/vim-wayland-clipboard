" wayland-clipboard.vim - Integrate with Wayland's clipboard when using the '+'
" register. Requires wl-clipboard and the +eval and +clipboard Vim features.
"
" This script was inspired by
" https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/ax9p9t/vim_and_system_clipboard_under_wayland/
" but uses an autocmd to allow yanking with operators to work.

" Early exit checks {{{

" only load this script once
if exists('g:loaded_wayland_clipboard')
    finish
endif
let g:loaded_wayland_clipboard = 1

" only run this on Wayland
if empty($WAYLAND_DISPLAY)
    finish
endif

" }}}

" Yanking {{{

" On Vim builds without 'clipboard', the '+' register doesn't work for
" yanking. My solution is to map '"+' to '"w' and send the 'w' register to the
" Wayland clipboard as well.
"
" This variable controls whether '"+' gets mapped to '"w'. It's on by default
" if the 'clipboard' feature isn't available, but the user can turn it off
" always if desired.
let s:plus_to_w = !has('clipboard') && !exists('g:wayland_clipboard_no_plus_to_w')

" remap '"+' to '"w' -- this will only apply to yanking since '"+p' and '"+P'
" are also remapped below
if s:plus_to_w
    nnoremap "+ "w
    vnoremap "+ "w
endif

" pass register contents to wl-copy if the '+' (or 'w') register was used
function! s:WaylandYank()
    if v:event['regname'] == '+' || (v:event['regname'] == 'w' && s:plus_to_w)
        if has("nvim")
            silent call jobstart(['wl-copy', '--', getreg(v:event['regname'])], {
                \   "in_io": "null", "out_io": "null", "err_io": "null",
                \   "stoponexit": "",
                \ })
        else
            silent call job_start(['wl-copy', '--', getreg(v:event['regname'])], {
                \   "in_io": "null", "out_io": "null", "err_io": "null",
